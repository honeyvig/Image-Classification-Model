# Image-Classification-Model
1) A CNN and VCG16-based image classifier that would give us how likely a person has a Heart disease

2) The Heart diseases can be Angina pectoris, Hypotension, Coronary Artery Disease, and Cardiovascular disease, or any other disease whose dataset of echocardiograms is available. A dataset of around a 1000 images per disease would be ideal

3)The dataset used should be Echocardiograms of the diseases, from which the CNN algorithm will extract features

4)we need a trained model something that will readily integrate with a website. And we may require your help in integrating it to our website

5)we need to know the diseases and their respective accuracy.

6) We would likely need the following things from you: the dataset of echocardiograms, the file wherein you built the model, the exported model along with its accuracy scores for each diseases
---------------
To build a deep learning model that classifies heart diseases based on echocardiogram images, you can utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) along with a pre-trained model like VGG16 for feature extraction. Here's an outline of how you can approach this project:
Approach Overview:

    Data Preprocessing:
        Load and preprocess the echocardiogram dataset, including resizing and normalizing the images.

    Model Architecture:
        Use VGG16 (a pre-trained model) as a feature extractor and fine-tune the last few layers.
        Alternatively, build a custom CNN model if you don't want to rely on pre-trained models.

    Training:
        Train the model on the labeled dataset of echocardiograms and evaluate it based on the accuracy for each disease class (Angina Pectoris, Hypotension, etc.).

    Integration:
        After training the model, export it as a .h5 file or other format.
        Integrate this model into a website using a Python backend (e.g., Flask or Django).

Steps to Achieve This
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Step 2: Dataset

You need a dataset of echocardiograms, ideally with labeled images for each disease. Let's assume the dataset is stored in folders named according to the diseases, e.g., /Angina/, /Hypotension/, etc. A common format would be .jpg or .png files.
Step 3: Model Building

Here's the Python code using VGG16 as the base model and adding custom layers for classification:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import os

# Define constants
IMG_SIZE = 224  # Size to which images will be resized
BATCH_SIZE = 32
EPOCHS = 10
CLASSES = ['Angina', 'Hypotension', 'Coronary Artery Disease', 'Cardiovascular Disease']  # Example classes

# Load and preprocess the dataset
def load_data(base_dir):
    # Image data augmentation and preprocessing
    datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255.0, validation_split=0.2)
    
    # Train and validation data generators
    train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
        base_dir,
        target_size=(IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE),
        batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
        class_mode='categorical',
        subset='training'
    )

    validation_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
        base_dir,
        target_size=(IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE),
        batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
        class_mode='categorical',
        subset='validation'
    )
    
    return train_generator, validation_generator

# Define the model architecture
def create_model():
    # Load VGG16 model pre-trained on ImageNet, excluding the top layer
    base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, 3))
    
    # Freeze the layers of VGG16 base model
    for layer in base_model.layers:
        layer.trainable = False

    # Build custom top layers
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(base_model)
    model.add(layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D())  # Pool the features from the VGG16 model
    model.add(layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.Dropout(0.5))
    model.add(layers.Dense(len(CLASSES), activation='softmax'))  # Output layer
    
    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    return model

# Main function to load data, build and train the model
def main():
    # Path to your dataset folder
    base_dir = '/path/to/your/echocardiogram/dataset'  # Change to your dataset path
    
    # Load and preprocess the data
    train_generator, validation_generator = load_data(base_dir)
    
    # Create the model
    model = create_model()
    
    # Train the model
    history = model.fit(
        train_generator,
        epochs=EPOCHS,
        validation_data=validation_generator
    )
    
    # Save the trained model
    model.save('heart_disease_model.h5')
    print("Model saved as 'heart_disease_model.h5'")

    # Evaluate the model
    test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(validation_generator)
    print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy*100:.2f}%")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Step 4: Explanation

    VGG16 Model: We use VGG16 as a pre-trained model. It is a popular model for image classification tasks. We remove the final classification layers and add custom layers for our specific problem.

    Image Preprocessing: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized between 0 and 1.

    Image Augmentation: We use ImageDataGenerator to handle data augmentation and split the data into training and validation sets.

    Model Training: The model is trained using the training data, and we validate it using a validation set. The model is saved after training as heart_disease_model.h5.

    Evaluation: The model is evaluated on the validation set, and the accuracy is printed.

Step 5: Model Export and Accuracy

    The trained model is saved as heart_disease_model.h5.
    You can load this model in your website backend using TensorFlow to make predictions for new echocardiogram images.

Step 6: Integration with Website

To integrate this model into your website:

    Backend: Use a Python web framework like Flask or Django to host the model and create endpoints for predictions.
    Frontend: Create an interface where users can upload echocardiogram images and display the results (e.g., likelihood of each disease).
    API: Use the trained model to generate predictions via an API (for example, using Flask's predict() method for incoming image requests).

Step 7: Example of Loading and Using the Model for Prediction

from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

# Load the saved model
model = load_model('heart_disease_model.h5')

# Function to predict disease from an image
def predict_disease(image_path):
    img = image.load_img(image_path, target_size=(IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE))
    img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
    img_array /= 255.0  # Normalize the image

    predictions = model.predict(img_array)
    predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
    disease = CLASSES[predicted_class[0]]

    print(f"Predicted Disease: {disease}")
    return disease

# Example usage
image_path = 'path_to_test_image.jpg'
predict_disease(image_path)

Step 8: Conclusion

    Model: The model will be able to classify various heart diseases based on echocardiogram images.
    Accuracy: The accuracy for each disease class will be available after evaluation, and you can print the results from the test set.
    Integration: The model can be easily integrated into your website using Flask or Django for real-time predictions.
    Exported Model: You will have the model saved as heart_disease_model.h5 ready for integration.

This approach ensures a scalable, reliable solution to predict heart diseases from echocardiogram images while providing actionable insights.
